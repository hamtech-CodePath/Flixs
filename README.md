# Flixs
Week 1 - This week we'll dive right in and build a Flicks app that showcases movie reviews. You'll start on it by yourself with a couple video walkthroughs on Monday, work on it some more in class with a partner on Tuesday, and then finish the rest on your own at home. Your completed app is due February 7th at 11:59pm.
